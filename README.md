# KukaHybridVisualServoing
Simulated reinforcement learning Environment for learning accurate manipulation over 2D surfaces with the KUKA LBR iiwa via a Hybrid Visual Servoing method.

Simulation is developed in PyBullet, with TFAgents used as the wrapper for the environment logic for reinforcement learning algorithms.
An additional script for initialising and commencing training on the environment is provided to help users get started.
